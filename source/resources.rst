Resources
*********

I highly recommend the following resources to continue your learning:

- `Django Girls tutorial <http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/>`_
- `Official Django tutorial 
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_
- `Test Driven Development
  <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html>`_

The last is only relevant if you are serious about web development.
